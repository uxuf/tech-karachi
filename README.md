#On the use of technology in Karachi
I am usually very wary on comparing the state of technology in general use that I see in Karachi with other places I have been. But in this case I felt I needed to jot down these thoughts, partly because I need to get them off my chest, and partly in the hope that it just might compel someone somewhere to improve a bit of technology infrastructure that might, in turn, lead to a lot less friction in people's lives, if not making their lives better _outright_.

> **The minute that you understand that you can poke life and actually something will, you know if you push in, something will pop out the other side, that you can change it, you can mold it. That’s maybe the most important thing. It’s to shake off this erroneous notion that life is there and you’re just gonna live in it, versus embrace it, change it, improve it, make your mark upon it.** -- Steve Jobs

##WiFi

WiFi in restaurants/coffee places/malls/other public spots should really be without a password, if you provide that service to your customers. **There is no additional security to be had if you hand out your WiFi password to those customers who ask for it.** It's as good as having no password at all.

If you are concerned about your own business' communication being out in the open, maintain a separate locked down WiFi SSID and never hand that one out to any customer.

Remember, an unsecured WiFi is not necessarily an insecure WiFi.

WiFi conglomerates: hook up to form an umbrella WiFi provider, or a service provider should sign up businesses and provide WiFi at their locations with SSO. This has been implemented successfully all over the world.

##Online Presence

The Internet is not just an entertainment portal, it's a gateway of information as well. If you have a business, you must have a website. You absolutely CANNOT afford to have a business without a well-thought out website. It ranks right up there with listing your business in the yellow pages. It **is** that important.

And if you have a website, populate it with relevant information.

###Social Networks
Make sure that your online presence and your bricks-and-mortar presence are in sync. 

If you have a Facebook presence and run a page, do NOT act like an overlord with complete dominating control over your page. If there are dissenting voices, follow up with them and try to resolve their issues. Show some sense: an unhappy customer is a lost customer.

A thriving Facebook page is well and good but do not neglect your own website, especially since access to any of the major websites could be revoked any time at the whims of our arguably clueless bureaucracy.

###Mobile Apps/Websites
Totally up to the business, usually beneficial. App vs website is a lively debate but the rule of thumb is that you need native apps if you provide custom content, otherwise a mobile-friendly website would do just fine. 

##Give up doing this!
Give up Flash on websites, seriously, just GIVE UP ALREADY!

Give up romanized Urdu for your promotions. Software like [Google Input Tools][1] hook up to most CMS backends and all of Google products. There is also a [Chrome extension available][2]. Using romanized Urdu serves no purpose at all:

1. Makes you look amateurish
2. People having trouble understanding English would probably have issues reading roman Urdu as well. Easier to read Urdu, in Urdu.
3. It's totally jarring and rude for everyone else, not to mention it's absolutely lame.
4. If your CMS can't handle UTF-8 Urdu characters, give it up and move to something better.

Give up marquees and blink tags. Seriously, it's 2013, not 1995.

##Why should I care?
Go read that Steve Jobs quote again. If you can provide these improvements, more power to you. If you're a customer, *demand* these improvements. Remember, customer is king.
