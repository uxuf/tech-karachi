#The State of the Internet in Pakistan

##WiFi

WiFi in restaurants/coffee places, without a password

WiFi conglomerates: hook up to form an umbrella WiFi provider, or a service provider should sign up businesses and provide WiFi at their locations with SSO. This has been implemented successfully all over the world. Examples?


##Online Presence

The Internet is not just an entertainment portal, it's a gateway of information as well. If you have a business, you must have a website. You absolutely CANNOT afford to have a business without a well-thought out website. It ranks right up there with listing your business in the yellow pages. It **IS** that important.

###Social Networks
Make sure that your online presence and your bricks-and-mortar presence are in sync. If you have a Facebook presence and run a page, do NOT act like an overlord with complete dominating control over your page. If there are dissenting voices, follow up with them and try to resolve their issues. Show some sense.

###Mobile Apps/Websites
Totally up to the business, usually beneficial. App vs website is a lively debate but the rule of thumb is that you need native apps if you provide custom content, otherwise a mobile-friendly website would do just fine. 

##Give up doing this!
Give up Flash on websites, seriously, just GIVE UP ALREADY!

Give up romanized urdu for your promotions. Tools like Google IME hook up to most CMS backends (needs verification). Using romanized Urdu serves no purpose at all:

1. Makes you look amateurish
2. People having trouble understanding English would probably have issues reading roman Urdu as well. Easier to read Urdu, in Urdu.
3. It's totally jarring and rude for everyone else, not to mention it's absolutely lame.
